# Radio-Mast-Visulisation
Introduction :
Daniel, the manager of a telecoms company wants to apply analytical techniques so that he can predict if a RF radio mast, used in mobile phone communication, is susceptible to outages due to adverse weather conditions. 
Daniel’s company has a large nationwide network of RF radio masts and these are affected by ‘outages’ due to adverse weather conditions, mainly very heavy rain and heavy mist. Outages mean that 
there is no available mobile phone service. The dataset contains total number of observations 2186 and 79 Variables having the Eng_class as a response variable
